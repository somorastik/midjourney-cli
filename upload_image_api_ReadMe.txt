The function post_to_api takes two arguments: api_key and image. These arguments correspond to the key and image parameters in the curl command. The URL of the API endpoint is hardcoded in the function.

The parameters dictionary contains the parameters for the API call, and the files dictionary contains the file that is being uploaded. These dictionaries are passed as the data and files parameters, respectively, to the requests.post method.

The response from the API is stored in the response variable. The response.status_code property is used to check if the request was successful (HTTP status code 200), and if so, the function returns the JSON data from the response using response.json(). If the request was not successful, the function returns None.
